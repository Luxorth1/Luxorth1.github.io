## Introduction

While I come to the close of my journey with Flatiron school I have began reflecting on my experience through this program, and the college experience. I have a relativiely unique situation where I graduated college, in Computer Science, but also did a technical boot camp less than a year after graduating. I will go into more details as to why I specifically chose this path, but I will say now that it is one I am happy to have walked and continue to. I will touch base on both experiences, give some background to the experiences. Then I will begin to go into more details regarding the reason I value one over the other. 

## College

I went to Niagara University in Upstate New York to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Computer & Information Science. During this 4 year program I also participated in ROTC in order to commission as an officer in the Military. The program went well, I did decently in my courses, the University that I attended required a number of additional required courses that was not relevant to my goals at all. These courses caused some motivation issues as I was not learning anything that I was remotely interested in, on top of that the Computer Science corses were very general. They never really dived deep into the relevant topics for the industry, mostly surface level knowledge you can find on YouTube. However, the one massive benefit of college is just simply the college experience, it was a fantastic time. Mentally I was in a pretty good spot for learning, outside of the curriculum that was not relevant. It was generally a very manageable schedule that did not cause too much overwhelming stress or anxiety. Despite the fact that I felt my college degree was worth a lot less than I had hoped, the experience was invaluable. 

## Technical Bootcamp

In March of 2020, before the world went insane I began to start my continued education with Flatiron School's Data Science course. Originally, I was incredibly torn between going back to school for a Masters degree, however looking back on my previous experience in college it seemed like the best idea to look for other options. I did loads of reasearch on Bootcamps and what the benefits were, and I felt like it was a perfect fit for me. I hit the nail on the head with that, the Part-Time Online Data Science course was a perfect fit. I was able to generally make my own schedule while also having an instructor to guide me through the material. It had the perfect blend of freedom of schedule, and structure. The material had a nice logical flow to it, and it went really in the weeds about topics, but also let you decide if you wanted to go deeper into the topic with tertiary lessons at the end of the sections. The projects were cumulative, meaning that each project was a different topic, but utilized all of the previous project's lessons. This allowed you to solidify older material while flexing your coding muscles on the newer topics. It was a refreshing change of pace, however there were times where life would happen and I would fall behind a bit. When this happened I was able to reach out to my instructor and work on a plan to catch up, it was a fantastic system that really accelerated my career and technical abilities. The offer of career services was also a large benefit to the whole program, it provides some level of confidence when it comes to finding a job after the Bootcamp is over, I had minimal assistance from my University as far as career services goes.


## Conclusion

Overall, people learn different ways, Bootcamps offer a plethora of different, flexible models that can fit just about any learner. College is more of a life experience where you learn some industry knowledge along the way. I cannot necessarily recommend one or the other without understanding how someone learns. For me, the Bootcamp was the way to go, however I would not sacrifice the college experience in its stead.
